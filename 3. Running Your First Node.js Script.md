### Topic 3: Running Your First Node.js Script

Now that Node.js and npm are installed, let’s write and run your **first real Node.js script**. This topic is all about understanding how to create a file, write Node.js code inside it, and execute it using the terminal or command prompt.

---

## 🔹 What Is a Node.js Script?

A Node.js script is a file (usually with the `.js` extension) that contains JavaScript code which is executed using the Node.js runtime (instead of a browser). Unlike client-side JavaScript, this script can access the file system, server resources, and more.

## 🔹 Step-by-Step Guide: Writing and Running Your First Script

### ✅ Step 1: Create a Folder for Your Project

Let’s keep things organized. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
mkdir node-first-script
cd node-first-script
```

This creates a folder named `node-first-script` and moves into it.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Create a JavaScript File

Now, create a new JavaScript file inside this folder. You can do this manually or through the terminal.

Using the terminal:

```bash
touch app.js  # For macOS/Linux
```

Or on Windows:

```bash
type nul > app.js
```

Or manually create a file named `app.js` using any code editor (VS Code, Notepad++, etc.).

---

### ✅ Step 3: Write Your First Node.js Code

Open `app.js` in your editor and write the following:

```javascript
// app.js
console.log("Welcome to Node.js!");
```

This is your first Node.js program. Here, `console.log()` prints a message to the terminal.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Run the Script Using Node

Make sure your terminal is inside the project folder. Run:

```bash
node app.js
```

You should see:

```
Welcome to Node.js!
```

Congratulations! 🎉 You've just executed your first Node.js script.

## 🔹 Exploring More: Add Variables and Logic

Let’s make the script more interesting.

Update `app.js` to:

```javascript
// app.js
let userName = "Amit";
let currentTime = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();

console.log(`Hello, ${userName}!`);
console.log(`Current time is: ${currentTime}`);
```

Now run:

```bash
node app.js
```

Output:

```
Hello, Amit!
Current time is: 10:45:23 AM
```

This shows you can use variables, objects (`Date`), and template strings—all standard JavaScript features—in Node.js.

---

## 🔹 Read Command Line Arguments

Node.js lets you pass arguments to your script via the terminal.

Update `app.js`:

```javascript
// app.js
let name = process.argv[2]; // 3rd argument (0 is node, 1 is app.js)
console.log(`Hello, ${name || "Guest"}!`);
```

Run the script with an argument:

```bash
node app.js Amit
```

Output:

```
Hello, Amit!
```

If no argument is passed:

```
Hello, Guest!
```

🔍 `process.argv` is a Node.js global that stores command-line arguments in an array.

---

## 🔹 Add Simple Logic (Bonus)

Update `app.js` again:

```javascript
// app.js
let age = parseInt(process.argv[2]);

if (isNaN(age)) {
  console.log("Please enter a valid age.");
} else if (age < 18) {
  console.log("You're underage.");
} else {
  console.log("You're eligible.");
}
```

Run:

```bash
node app.js 22
```

Output:

```
You're eligible.
```

This shows how Node.js scripts can take input, perform logic, and output results—just like any real program!

---

## 🔹 Debugging Tip

If your script doesn’t run:

1. Ensure you’re in the correct folder (`cd node-first-script`).
2. Check that the file name is correct (`app.js`).
3. Run using: `node app.js`
